##Investigated Data Sets

| Name                    | k |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- | 
| Airline Safety Record     | [Article on fivethirthyeight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/should-travelers-avoid-flying-airlines-that-have-had-crashes-in-the-past/)                   |

##Guide for R source code

| R source code | What it does |
|---------------|--------------|
|**Data_Assignment01.R** | loads necessary data and packages |
|**analysis_dataset01.R** | analytical investigation into airline safety data |
|**Alcohol_Consumption.R**| analytical investigation of drinking |

The later files are linked to the Descriptive Statistics files - which are then both linked to our basic script.

Create a new public GitHub Repository. The repository should be fully documented, including an informative README.md file. The repository should also include R source code files that acces at least two data sets from fivethirtyeight. 

Perform basic transformations on the data, and illustrate the datas' distributions using a variety **relevant of descriptive statistics**. 

At least one file must **dynamically link** to another in a substantively meaningful way. Finally, another pair must make a pull request and it should be discussed and merged.
